# Project title: Google-Homepage-Clone
This is a quick, non-functional "clone" of the Google homepage, as prescribed in The Odin Project. The cloning project includes both the search page and the results page and focuses on HTML / CSS only - no Javascript or backend. Please see http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css.
